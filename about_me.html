        <h2>Introduction about myself!</h2>
        <p class="one">Hi, I am <i><b>Vanitha</b></i>. I am from Madanapalle. I completed my College from Aditya College of Engineering which is affiliated to 
            JNTUA University. I completed my twelfth grade from Sri Siddartha Jr College  with 9.59CGPA from CBSE Boards. I have done my 
            Schooling in Vivekanamda Municipal High School.<br><br>


            My family includes my father who is an Weaver, my mother who is a Tailor and my sister who 
            is pursuing her degree in  bcom Computers  from Srinivasa College.
            At school, We participated in all the activities of the school and enjoyed our school days.

            I am basically an extrovert person and so I make friends very easily. I have so many 
            friends and we all enjoy a lot. I visit their homes and they also visit my home. I also like 
            drawing and painting .At school we have the coaching for these and so it makes it easy for me to learn well, these sport activities. 
            During my free time, I draw pictures and paint them. I have done three four paintings that 
            have been put up at my home.</p>
